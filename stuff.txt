alert for onclick
boolean expressions

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
- generatePassword() function - need to connect this to the onClick event with the button
--commit after

THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
- need to prompt user

WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password

WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
- need the length to be valid
	-- assign this to a variable called passwordLength
	-- check whether passwordLength is valid
		-- valid means: needs to be at least 8 characters, no more than 128 characters
		if password.Length >= 8 characters AND <= 128 characters

WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
	--boolean variables

WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
	--at least one of lowercase, uppercase, numeric, special has to be true

WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
	-- generate password
	-- since it's random, it's going to involve Math.random()
	-- the rock/paper/scissors activity already addressed selecting randomly from arrays

WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
	-- last piece is to display the password
	-- console.log the password before displaying it 

boolean = use another kind of prompt? confirm prompt
